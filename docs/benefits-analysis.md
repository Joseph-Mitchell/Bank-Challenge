# Benefits Analysis
## Problem
If customers want to access their bank account they need to come into the bank and talk to a bank teller to make requests.
<br><br>
This can be inconvenient for many reasons, for instance most of any customers' free time will lie outside of bank opening hours, forcing them to visit the bank in a very short window of time which may not be comfortable or possible for them. Additionally, bank holidays and other variables affecting bank opening hours may further cause inconvenience to customers.<br><br>
The program fixes this issue by providing an automated banking service for customers to withdraw and deposit money, as well as to view a statement of previous transactions. This system would be available any hour of the day as due to being automated it does not need to be operated by a person.

## Benefits
- The system is available 24/7, so customers won't need to plan ahead for simple banking requests.
- The convenience of the system may attract more customers from banks without this system.
- Many of the manual systems in place to avoid human error would be replaced by automatic error checking, freeing up time and resources for other company operations.

## Risks
- Errors in the system may require bank staff to take time to correct them.
- Errors resulting in too much money being given to customers may result in losses to the company.
- If the system has many errors or is in other ways unreliable, customers may be lost to other banks with more reliable systems.
